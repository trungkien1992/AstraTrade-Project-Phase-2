# Failure Hypothesis

## Suspected Root Causes

### Primary Hypothesis: Bracket Mismatch in Widget Tree
- **Breakpoint:** TradeEntryScreen build() method around line 46
- **Evidence:** Xcode consistently reports missing ')' at same location
- **Likelihood:** HIGH - Dart analyzer also flagged this location

### Secondary Hypothesis: Analytics Call Placement
- **Breakpoint:** AnalyticsService.trackScreenView call in build method
- **Evidence:** Error appeared after GameStatsBar integration
- **Action Taken:** Moved to initState() but error persists
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - May have introduced cascading syntax issues

### Tertiary Hypothesis: Widget Import/Integration Issue
- **Breakpoint:** GameStatsBar widget integration at line 80
- **Evidence:** Error started after adding `const GameStatsBar(),` to Column children
- **Likelihood:** LOW - Widget itself analyzes cleanly

## Known Flaky Areas
- Flutter build cache can hold onto stale syntax errors
- Xcode build sometimes reports wrong line numbers for Dart syntax errors
- iOS simulator builds more sensitive to certain syntax patterns than debug builds

## Observability Signals
- Dart analyzer reports different error location than Xcode
- Flutter clean + pub get changes error message but doesn't resolve
- Error is consistent across multiple build attempts

## Invariants to Check
1. All opening brackets have matching closing brackets
2. All method calls have proper parameter lists
3. Widget tree structure is valid Flutter syntax
4. Import statements are complete and correct
