# iOS Simulator Investigation - Assumptions & Open Questions

## Primary Assumptions

### Project Structure Assumptions
1. **Assumption:** `/AstraTrade-Demo-iOS/` and `/apps/frontend/` are separate implementations
   - **Risk:** Code duplication or feature drift
   - **Validation Needed:** Compare file structures and implementation differences

2. **Assumption:** iOS simulator requires specific Flutter/Dart configuration
   - **Risk:** Missing platform-specific dependencies
   - **Validation Needed:** Check `pubspec.yaml` and iOS project settings

3. **Assumption:** Verified features were tested on `/apps/frontend/` but not `/AstraTrade-Demo-iOS/`
   - **Risk:** Feature parity gaps between implementations
   - **Validation Needed:** Cross-reference feature implementations

### Technical Integration Assumptions
4. **Assumption:** Web3Auth requires iOS-specific SDK configuration
   - **Risk:** Missing iOS permissions or bundle configurations
   - **Validation Needed:** Check iOS `Info.plist` and Web3Auth iOS setup

5. **Assumption:** Starknet libraries are compatible with iOS Simulator
   - **Risk:** Native library incompatibilities with x86_64/arm64 simulator architectures
   - **Validation Needed:** Check starknet_provider and crypto library compatibility

6. **Assumption:** Extended Exchange API works identically across platforms
   - **Risk:** iOS-specific network restrictions or CORS issues
   - **Validation Needed:** Test API connectivity from iOS environment

### Environment Assumptions
7. **Assumption:** iOS Simulator has network access for API calls
   - **Risk:** Simulator networking restrictions
   - **Validation Needed:** Test basic HTTP requests from simulator

8. **Assumption:** Cosmic theme assets are properly bundled for iOS
   - **Risk:** Asset loading issues or font registration problems
   - **Validation Needed:** Check asset bundle and font registration

## Open Questions

### Architecture Questions
- **Q1:** Are `/AstraTrade-Demo-iOS/` and `/apps/frontend/` meant to be synchronized?
- **Q2:** Which project should be considered the "source of truth" for features?
- **Q3:** What is the intended deployment strategy (iOS-specific vs unified Flutter)?

### Configuration Questions  
- **Q4:** What iOS-specific configurations are required for Web3Auth?
- **Q5:** Are there iOS Simulator limitations affecting Starknet integration?
- **Q6:** What network permissions are required for Extended Exchange API?

### Build Questions
- **Q7:** What Flutter version and dependencies are required for iOS compilation?
- **Q8:** Are there platform-specific build flags or configurations needed?
- **Q9:** What iOS SDK version is targeted for simulator compatibility?

## Unknown Factors

### Development Environment
- Current Flutter/Dart SDK version compatibility
- Xcode version and iOS Simulator configuration
- Local vs CI build environment differences

### Third-Party Dependencies
- Web3Auth iOS SDK version and setup requirements
- Starknet library iOS compatibility status
- Extended Exchange API iOS-specific requirements

### Runtime Behavior
- iOS Simulator performance characteristics vs physical devices
- Networking behavior differences in simulator environment
- Asset loading and rendering differences

## Critical Risks Identified

### High Risk
1. **Feature Implementation Drift:** `/AstraTrade-Demo-iOS/` may be outdated compared to `/apps/frontend/`
2. **iOS Platform Incompatibilities:** Third-party libraries may not work in iOS Simulator
3. **Configuration Gaps:** Missing iOS-specific setup for Web3Auth or Starknet integration

### Medium Risk  
4. **Build System Issues:** Flutter/iOS build configuration problems
5. **Asset Loading Problems:** Cosmic theme assets not properly bundled for iOS
6. **Network Restrictions:** iOS Simulator networking limitations affecting API calls

### Low Risk
7. **Performance Issues:** Simulator performance affecting feature rendering
8. **Version Mismatches:** Flutter or dependency version incompatibilities

## Validation Strategy

### Immediate Validation Required
1. Compare file structures between `/AstraTrade-Demo-iOS/` and `/apps/frontend/`
2. Check `pubspec.yaml` dependencies in both projects
3. Examine iOS-specific configuration files (`Info.plist`, etc.)
4. Verify Flutter build configuration for iOS

### Technical Testing Required
1. Test basic app launch in iOS Simulator
2. Verify network connectivity from simulator environment
3. Check asset loading and theme rendering
4. Test Web3Auth initialization and configuration

### Integration Testing Required
1. Validate Starknet library functionality in simulator
2. Test Extended Exchange API connectivity
3. Verify paymaster integration availability
4. Check complete feature flow from UI to backend
