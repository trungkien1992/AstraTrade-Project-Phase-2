- Provide manual cleanup commands and tools
- Compress archived sessions for long-term storage

**Rollback Plan:**

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (Complex integration with many touch points)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive backward compatibility testing
- Phased rollout with feature flags
- Migration tools for existing session data
- Fallback to existing functionality if MARM fails
- Version checking and compatibility validation

**Rollback Plan:**

- Provide tools to extract data from MARM format

**Monitoring:**
- Existing session access success rates
- User workflow completion metrics
- Error rates in session operations

### RISK-I2: Command Interface Confusion
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Description:** New `/notebook` commands could confuse users or conflict with existing patterns.

**Impact:**

- Reduced adoption of new features
- Support burden from user errors

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (New command patterns require learning)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Clear documentation and help integration
- Consistent command naming conventions
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Interactive help and command completion
- User feedback collection and iteration

**Rollback Plan:**
- Simplify command interface based on feedback
- Hide advanced features behind flags
- Provide alternative access methods

**Monitoring:**
- Command usage patterns and error rates
