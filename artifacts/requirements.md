# Requirements - Notebook Context Management Integration

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Session Command Extensions
**Requirement:** Extend existing Claude Code session commands with MARM notebook capabilities while preserving all existing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `session-start` initializes MARM session alongside standard session creation
- `session-current` displays notebook entries and session statistics  
- `session-end` compiles final context and persists session data
- All existing session behaviors work unchanged
- New MARM features are additive, not replacing existing functionality

**Test Coverage:** Command integration tests, backward compatibility validation

### FR-2: Notebook Management Commands  
**Requirement:** Implement `/notebook` style commands for direct notebook entry management.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/notebook show:` lists all entries with usage statistics
- `/notebook add:[key] [value]` adds validated entries with rate limiting
- `/notebook get:[key]` retrieves specific entries  
- `/notebook delete:[key]` removes entries with confirmation
- Commands follow Claude Code markdown format and error handling patterns
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (300ms cooldown between additions)

**Test Coverage:** Command parsing, validation, rate limiting, error handling

### FR-3: Workflow Auto-Logging
**Requirement:** Automatically log workflow-comprehensive stages to notebook entries for continuity tracking.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Express stage: Captures 4W1H summary and scope hypothesis
- Ask gate: Records stakeholder feedback and approved assumptions
- Explore stage: Logs key research findings and context insights
- Plan stage: Documents architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Auto-logging can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- Logged entries include timestamps and stage identifiers

**Test Coverage:** Workflow integration tests, auto-logging behavior validation

### FR-4: Context Compilation Enhancement
**Requirement:** Integrate MARM context compilation with existing Claude Code memory management.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `get_session_context()` provides structured context including notebook entries
- Token-aware compilation with configurable compact mode
- Integration with existing `.claude/memory/current-session-context.md`
- Context includes workflow history, recent logs, conversation history
- Fallback to existing context management if MARM fails

**Test Coverage:** Context compilation accuracy, token estimation, fallback behavior

### FR-5: Persistent Storage Integration
**Requirement:** Implement file-based persistence using MARM FileStorage with Claude Code session directory integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Storage location: `.claude/sessions/notebook-storage.json`
- Atomic file operations with corruption recovery
- Thread-safe concurrent access
- Automatic directory creation and permission handling
- JSON format with UTF-8 encoding support

**Test Coverage:** File operations, concurrency, corruption recovery, permissions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
**Requirement:** MARM integration must not significantly impact Claude Code session performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Session startup time increase < 100ms
- Notebook operations complete within 50ms (except rate-limited)
- Context compilation time < 200ms for typical sessions
- Memory usage increase < 10MB for active sessions
- File I/O operations use efficient JSON serialization

**Test Coverage:** Performance benchmarks, load testing, memory profiling

### NFR-2: Reliability
**Requirement:** System must gracefully handle failures and maintain data integrity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Storage failures don't break session functionality
- Corrupted data recovery with validation
- Thread-safe operations prevent race conditions
- Atomic file writes prevent data loss
- Error logging with actionable recovery information

**Test Coverage:** Failure injection, concurrency testing, data integrity validation

### NFR-3: Usability
**Requirement:** Integration must be intuitive and non-disruptive to existing workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New features discoverable through help commands
- Error messages clear and actionable
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Backward compatibility with all existing session commands
- Documentation integrated with existing Claude Code help system

**Test Coverage:** User experience testing, help system validation, compatibility testing

### NFR-4: Maintainability  
**Requirement:** Code must be maintainable and extensible following established patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Uses existing MARM implementation without modification
- Follows Claude Code command pattern conventions
- Clear separation between MARM integration and existing functionality
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Configuration options for customization

**Test Coverage:** Code quality metrics, maintainability analysis, extensibility testing

### NFR-5: Security
**Requirement:** Session data must be stored securely with appropriate access controls.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JSON storage files have restrictive permissions (600)
- No sensitive information stored in notebook entries
- Local storage only (no network transmission)
- User control over data retention and deletion
- Secure temporary file handling during writes

**Test Coverage:** Security testing, permission validation, data handling audit

## Integration Requirements

**Requirement:** Seamless integration with existing Claude Code command infrastructure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Commands work through existing Claude Code invocation methods
- Integration with TodoWrite tool for task tracking
- Compatible with workflow-comprehensive command patterns
- Help system integration and command discovery
- Error handling consistent with existing commands

### IR-2: File System Integration
**Requirement:** Compatible integration with Claude Code file system conventions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Uses `.claude/` directory structure conventions
- Compatible with existing session file naming patterns
- Respects git ignore patterns and project structure
