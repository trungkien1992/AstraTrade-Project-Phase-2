# Phase 1: Game Stats Integration Hypothesis

## Title
Add Game Stats Bar to TradeEntryScreen for iOS Gameplay Enhancement

## Owner
Claude Development Assistant

## Problem
Users currently see only basic trading interface without any gamification elements or progression feedback, missing the opportunity to engage with the comprehensive gameplay system that already exists in the codebase.

## Hypothesis
If we add a game stats bar (showing Stellar Shards, XP, and Level) to the top of TradeEntryScreen for iOS simulator users, user engagement with the trading interface will increase by at least 15% within 1 week as measured by session duration and successful trade completion rate.

## Metric
- **Primary**: Average session duration on TradeEntryScreen
- **Secondary**: Successful trade completion rate
- **Secondary**: User retention (return visits within 7 days)

## Baseline
- **Current session duration**: ~2-3 minutes (estimated based on basic trading flow)
- **Current trade completion rate**: ~60% (estimated - users who start trade process actually complete it)
- **Current retention**: Unknown (needs measurement)

## Target Δ
- **Session duration**: +15% increase (2.3-2.6 minutes → 2.6-3.0 minutes)
- **Trade completion**: +10% increase (60% → 66%)
- **Visual engagement**: Users interact with stats display at least once per session

## Timeframe
- **Development**: 2-4 hours
- **Testing**: 1-2 hours  
- **Measurement period**: 7 days after deployment

## Confidence
**Medium (70%)** - Game stats are proven engagement drivers in mobile gaming, and the cosmic theme already resonates with users

## Risks
1. **Technical**: Integration with existing GameStateProvider might have dependency issues
2. **UX**: Stats bar might clutter the clean trading interface
3. **Performance**: Additional state watching might slow down iOS simulator
4. **User Confusion**: New elements might confuse existing trading workflow

## Guardrails
1. **Performance**: Page load time increase ≤ 200ms
2. **Error Rate**: No increase in crash rate or Flutter errors
3. **UX**: Trading workflow completion rate must not decrease
4. **Rollback**: Feature flag implementation allows instant disable
5. **iOS Compatibility**: Must work smoothly in iOS simulator without lag

## Success Criteria
- Users notice and interact with game stats
- Trading completion rate maintained or improved
- No performance degradation on iOS simulator
- Positive visual integration with existing cosmic theme
