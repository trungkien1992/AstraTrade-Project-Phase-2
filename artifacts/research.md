# Research - MARM Integration Best Practices

## MARM System Analysis

### Core Capabilities from Implementation
**MARM v1.5.0 Protocol Features:**
- Session memory with history, logs, notebook entries  
- Rate-limited validation (300ms cooldown, 30 entry limit)
- Context compilation with token awareness
- Storage abstraction (Memory/File/Custom backends)
- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Session pruning (30 days expiry, 50 session limit)

**Enhanced Features (User Modifications):**
- File-based persistence with JSON storage
- Configuration system (compact mode, Unicode keys, no-emoji)
- Improved error handling and validation
- Debug logging and session statistics
- Storage adapter pattern for extensibility

## Claude Code Integration Patterns

### Command Extension Research
**Existing Pattern Analysis:**
- Commands are markdown files with imperative instructions
- Session management uses file-based state (`.current-session`)  
- Workflow commands integrate with artifact generation
- TodoWrite tool provides task tracking integration

**Integration Approaches:**
1. **Wrapper Pattern:** Extend existing commands to call MARM functions
2. **Hybrid Pattern:** Parallel MARM sessions alongside existing sessions
3. **Enhancement Pattern:** Augment existing functionality with MARM features

**Recommended:** Enhancement Pattern - preserves existing behavior while adding MARM capabilities

### Session Management Research
**Current State Management:**
- `.claude/sessions/.current-session` tracks active session filename
- Session files use timestamp-based naming convention
- Manual session summaries with git/todo integration
- Context stored in separate `.claude/memory/` directory

**MARM Integration Strategy:**
- Map Claude session filenames to MARM session IDs
- Use FileStorage pointing to `.claude/sessions/notebook-storage.json`
- Preserve existing session file format, add MARM notebook data
- Context compilation enhances existing memory management

## Storage and Persistence Research

### FileStorage Implementation Analysis
**Capabilities:**
- Atomic file operations with thread safety
- Automatic directory creation
- JSON persistence with UTF-8 encoding
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Load-on-creation with corruption recovery

**Integration Considerations:**
- Single file storage reduces file system complexity
- JSON format allows easy inspection and debugging
- UTF-8 encoding supports international characters
- Thread safety critical for concurrent Claude Code operations

### Configuration Management Research
**MARM Configuration Options:**
```python
{
    "compact_mode_enabled": False,          # Token-aware context trimming
    "max_notebook_chars_compact": 100,      # Compact mode char limit
    "max_conversation_tokens_compact": 1000, # Compact mode token limit  
    "enable_unicode_keys": False,           # Unicode vs ASCII-only keys
    "no_emoji_mode": False,                 # Clean output for terminals
    "debug_logging": False                  # Detailed operation logging
}
```

**Claude Code Integration:**
- Default to clean terminal output (no_emoji_mode: true)
- Enable debug logging for development/troubleshooting
- Compact mode useful for large contexts
- Unicode keys based on user preference

## Command Interface Research

### Notebook Command Design
**Command Categories:**
1. **Management:** `/notebook show:`, `/notebook delete:[key]`
2. **Data Entry:** `/notebook add:[key] [value]`, `/notebook get:[key]`  
3. **Context:** `/compile`, `/memory`, `/session-context`
4. **Config:** `/notebook-config [setting] [value]`

**User Experience Considerations:**
- Consistent with existing Claude Code command patterns
- Clear syntax with descriptive error messages
- Progressive disclosure (advanced features optional)
- Help text integration with existing session help

### Workflow Integration Research
**Auto-Logging Opportunities:**
- Express stage: Project scope and 4W1H summary
- Ask gate: Stakeholder feedback and approved assumptions
- Explore stage: Key research findings and context insights
- Plan stage: Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Implementation: Progress updates and technical insights

**Context Compilation Benefits:**
- Structured project knowledge across sessions
- Workflow continuity during context switches
- Automated context for AI prompts
- Historical decision tracking

## Error Handling and Reliability Research

### Failure Modes and Mitigations
**Storage Failures:**
- File system errors → Graceful degradation to memory storage
- JSON corruption → Validation with fallback to empty state
- Permission issues → Clear error messages with recovery suggestions

**Session Failures:**
- MARM session creation fails → Continue with standard session only
- Notebook operations fail → Log errors, don't block session operations
- Context compilation fails → Fall back to existing context management

**Concurrency Issues:**
- Multiple Claude Code instances → File locking with timeout handling
- Session mutations → Thread-safe operations with RLock
- Storage operations → Atomic writes with rollback capability

### Monitoring and Observability
**Debug Logging Integration:**
- Session creation/restoration events
- Notebook entry additions/deletions
- Storage operation success/failure
- Context compilation performance
- Session pruning activities

**Session Statistics:**
- Entry count and size utilization
- Session duration and activity
- Context compilation frequency
- Error rates and failure modes

## Performance Research

### Memory and Storage Impact
**MARM Memory Usage:**
- Session data structure overhead minimal
- JSON storage size scales with notebook entries
- Context compilation processing overhead
- Thread synchronization impact

**File System Impact:**
- Single JSON file vs multiple session files
- Atomic writes with intermediate files
- File size growth patterns with pruning
- Backup and recovery considerations

### Scalability Considerations
**Session Limits:**
- 50 sessions with 30-day expiry (MARM defaults)
- 30 notebook entries per session max
- 30,000 character notebook storage limit
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (300ms cooldown)

**Context Compilation Performance:**
- Token estimation accuracy vs speed
- Compact mode effectiveness for large contexts
- Memory usage during context generation
- Caching opportunities for repeated access

## Security and Privacy Research

### Data Protection
**Sensitive Information Handling:**
- API keys and secrets → Exclude from notebook entries
- Personal information → User control over retention
- Project details → Local storage only (no cloud sync)
- Session data → File permissions and access controls

**Storage Security:**
- JSON file permissions (600 - owner read/write only)
- Directory access controls (.claude/ directory protection)
- Temporary file handling during atomic writes
- Backup and recovery security considerations

### Privacy Considerations
**Data Retention:**
- 30-day automatic expiry of old sessions
- Manual session deletion capabilities
- Notebook entry deletion and cleanup
- Context compilation data handling

**User Control:**
- Persistence toggle (enable/disable storage)
- Manual session cleanup commands
- Configuration of retention policies
- Export/import capabilities for data portability
