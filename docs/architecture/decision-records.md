## ADR-001: Domain-Driven Design Adoption for Business Logic Organization

**Status:** Implemented (83% Complete - 5 of 6 domains)  
**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Updated:** 2025-08-01  
**Context:** Current codebase has 55+ backend services and 50+ frontend services without clear domain boundaries

### Decision
Restructure the entire codebase using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with bounded contexts to isolate complex business logic.

### Rationale
1. **Business Complexity:** Gamified trading involves multiple complex domains (trading, XP systems, social features, NFTs)
2. **Team Scaling:** Growing from 1 to 8 developers requires clear ownership boundaries
3. **Roadmap Requirements:** 4 distinct revenue streams need domain expertise isolation
4. **Service Explosion:** 55+ services indicate lack of cohesive organization

│    (Audit Trail, Compliance)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Financial Functions
```typescript
// Pure functions for financial calculations
type Position = {
  readonly asset: string;
  readonly quantity: Decimal;
  readonly entryPrice: Decimal;
  readonly currentPrice: Decimal;
};

const calculatePnL = (position: Position): Decimal => 
  position.quantity.mul(position.currentPrice.sub(position.entryPrice));

const calculatePositionSize = (
  accountBalance: Decimal,
  riskPercentage: Decimal,
  stopLossDistance: Decimal
): Decimal => 
  accountBalance.mul(riskPercentage).div(stopLossDistance);
```

### Implementation Strategy
- **Immutable Data:** All financial data structures are immutable

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Preserves 83% completed high-quality domain implementations
- Leverages team's strong Python expertise for faster development
- Enables immediate infrastructure deployment and microservices benefits
- Reduces project timeline from 18 weeks to 8 weeks
- Maintains working business logic during infrastructure transition

**Negative:**
- Mixed technology stack increases operational complexity
- Some performance optimization opportunities in Go may be delayed
- Requires careful interface design between Python and Go services
