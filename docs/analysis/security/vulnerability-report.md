# Security Vulnerability Report: AstraTrade Backend

**Report Date:** 2025-08-03
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Vulnerability Type:** Authentication Bypass & Identity Spoofing (Broken Access Control)
**Reporter:** Gemini Security Analysis

### 1. Executive Summary

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in the AstraTrade backend application. The system is susceptible to an **authentication bypass** at the API Gateway, which, when combined with a failure to validate client-supplied data, allows a malicious actor to **execute trades on behalf of any user** on the platform.

This flaw permits an unauthenticated attacker to perform unauthorized actions with catastrophic financial and reputational consequences, including draining user accounts, manipulating market data, and causing a complete loss of customer trust. **Immediate remediation is required.**

### 2. Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability arises from a chain of three distinct but related flaws that together dismantle the system's security posture.

#### 2.1. Flaw 1: Authentication Bypass in API Gateway

The `get_current_user` function in `api_gateway.py` is a mock implementation that does not perform any actual validation of the provided `Authorization` header. It only checks for the *presence* of a `Bearer` token.

-   **Location:** `apps/backend/api_gateway.py`
-   **Mechanism:** Any request containing a header like `Authorization: Bearer <any-value>` is incorrectly treated as fully authenticated.

#### 2.2. Flaw 2: Client-Controlled Identity in Trade Requests

The `/api/v1/trading/execute` endpoint accepts a `TradeRequest` object that contains a `user_id` field supplied directly by the client. The API Gateway forwards this client-controlled `user_id` to the downstream `trading-service` without validating it against the (mocked) authenticated user context.

-   **Location:** `apps/backend/api_gateway.py`
-   **Mechanism:** The identity established by the authentication layer is ignored, and the unvalidated, client-provided identity is used instead.

#### 2.3. Flaw 3: Implicit Trust in Downstream Services

The `trading-service` blindly trusts the `user_id` it receives in the payload from the API Gateway. It does not perform any secondary verification to ensure the user making the request is the same user for whom the trade is being executed.

-   **Location:** `apps/backend/services/trading/main.py`
-   **Mechanism:** The service operates on the assumption that all data received from the gateway is sanitized and validated, which is not the case.

### 3. Attack Scenario (Proof of Concept)

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability with a simple, forged HTTP request.

1.  **Attacker's Goal:** Execute a trade for a victim with `user_id: 999`.

2.  **Forged Request:** The attacker crafts the following request. The `Authorization` header is present but contains a fake token. The `user_id` is set to the victim's ID.

    ```http
    POST /api/v1/trading/execute HTTP/1.1
    Host: astratrade.app
    Authorization: Bearer FAKE-TOKEN-DOES-NOT-MATTER
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "user_id": 999,
      "asset_symbol": "BTC/USD",
      "direction": "SHORT",
      "amount": 100.0
    }
    ```

3.  **API Gateway Processing:**
    - The `get_current_user` function sees the `Bearer` token and incorrectly returns a generic "authenticated" user (e.g., `user_id: 123`).
    - The `execute_trade` endpoint ignores the authenticated `user_id` of `123` and forwards the entire client payload, including `"user_id": 999`, to the `trading-service`.

4.  **Trading-Service Execution:**
    - The `trading-service` receives the payload and extracts `"user_id": 999`.
    - It executes a trade for user 999 without any further checks, successfully completing the attack.

### 4. Impact Assessment

The impact of this vulnerability is **catastrophic**. An attacker can:
-   Execute unauthorized trades on any user's account.
-   Liquidate user positions, leading to direct financial loss for customers.
-   Manipulate the market by executing large, coordinated trades across multiple accounts.
-   Cause irreversible reputational damage to the AstraTrade platform.
-   Expose the company to significant legal and regulatory liabilities.

---

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

-   **Incomplete Security Implementation:** The authentication logic is a placeholder mock and was never fully implemented.
-   **Lack of Zero-Trust Architecture:** Services within the system implicitly trust each other and the data passed between them without verification.
-   **Failure to Enforce Server-Side Identity:** The system relies on a client-controlled identifier (`user_id`) instead of enforcing the server-validated identity from the authentication context.
-   **No Identity Propagation:** The authenticated user's identity is not securely propagated from the gateway to downstream services.

---

### 6. Remediation Recommendations

The following actions must be taken immediately to secure the platform:

1.  **Implement Real JWT Validation:** Replace the mock `get_current_user` function in `api_gateway.py` with a robust implementation that cryptographically validates JWTs, checks their expiration, and extracts the legitimate `user_id` from the token claims.

2.  **Enforce Server-Side Identity:** The API Gateway must be the single source of truth for user identity. It should **overwrite or ignore** any `user_id` provided in the client's request body. The validated `user_id` from the JWT token must be used instead.

3.  **Securely Propagate Identity:** Pass the validated `user_id` from the gateway to downstream services via a secure, internal-only HTTP header (e.g., `X-Authenticated-User-ID`). Downstream services must be configured to trust this header only from the API Gateway.

4.  **Add Authorization Logic:** Implement authorization checks to ensure that the authenticated user has the explicit permission to perform the requested action (e.g., User 123 can only trade for User 123).

By implementing these changes, the system will ensure that all actions are performed only by genuinely authenticated and authorized users, eliminating the risk of identity spoofing.
