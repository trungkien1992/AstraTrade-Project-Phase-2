# Architectural Advice

**Question**: Should I split the trading service into separate order and portfolio services?

## Analysis
**Current Domain**: trading
**Existing Patterns**: Domain Service Pattern, Repository Pattern
**Key Constraints**: High-frequency trading requirements, ACID transaction needs

## Recommendations
1. **Maintain Single Service**: Keep order and portfolio management together for transaction consistency
2. **Separate Read Models**: Use CQRS pattern to separate read/write concerns
3. **Internal Modularization**: Organize code into focused modules within the service
4. **Event Sourcing**: Use events for portfolio updates while maintaining consistency

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze transaction boundaries and consistency requirements
2. Implement CQRS pattern for read/write separation
3. Create internal modules for order processing and portfolio management
4. Add event sourcing for audit trail and eventual consistency
5. Test transactional consistency under high load

**Confidence Level**: 85%
```

### Example 3: Performance Optimization
```bash
./hrm-reason optimize "Database queries are slow during peak trading hours"
```

**Output:**
```markdown
# ⚡ Performance Optimization Recommendation

**Target Area**: Database Optimization

## Current Performance Assessment
High database query latency during peak load; N+1 query pattern detected

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize slow queries, add proper indexes
2. **Connection Management**: Implement connection pooling and optimize connection lifecycle
3. **Data Access Patterns**: Eliminate N+1 queries, use bulk operations
4. **Caching Layer**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Database Tuning**: Optimize database configuration

## Expected Performance Improvement
Expected improvements: 50-80% reduction in query response time; Eliminating N+1 queries can provide 5-10x improvement in database operations

**Confidence Level**: 92%

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: How is this different from existing code analysis tools?**
A: HRM uses hierarchical reasoning inspired by neuroscience, enabling deep multi-step analysis that considers context, trade-offs, and long-term implications.

**Q: Do I need GPU for inference?**
A: No, the model runs efficiently on CPU. GPU is only beneficial for training custom models.

**Q: Can I train it on my own codebase?**
A: Yes! Use the corpus builder to extract patterns from your codebase and fine-tune the model.

**Q: How accurate are the recommendations?**
A: The model achieves 74.5% accuracy on complex reasoning tasks, significantly better than standard approaches.

**Q: Is it specific to Python/Django?**
A: Currently optimized for Python, but the architecture supports multi-language extension.
