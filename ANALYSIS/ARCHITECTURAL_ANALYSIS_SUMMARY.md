    -   **Status:** Implemented (83% Complete).

-   **ADR-007: Infrastructure Bridge Strategy**
    -   **Status:** Approved for Next Phase. In progress.

## 2. Trading Domain Architecture: Centralization & Delegation

This section summarizes the key architectural approach for the Trading Domain.

### Core Pattern

The architecture uses a delegation pattern:

1.  **Centralized Domain Logic:** The `Trading Domain` is implemented within the AstraTrade backend using Domain-Driven Design. It encapsulates all core business rules, risk management, and portfolio logic.
2.  **Delegated Execution:** The actual execution of trades is delegated to an external service, **Extended Exchange**, via a clean `ExchangeClient` protocol.

### Key Benefits

This approach provides significant benefits:

-   **Business Logic Consistency:** A single source of truth for all trading rules and calculations.
-   **Enhanced Control & Governance:** Centralized audit trails, risk controls, and reporting.
-   **Specialized Infrastructure:** Leverages the high availability, liquidity, and regulatory compliance of Extended Exchange.
-   **Focus on Core Competencies:** Allows AstraTrade to focus on its unique value proposition (gamification, user experience) instead of building and maintaining complex trading infrastructure.

### Alignment with ADRs

This pattern is fully aligned with the project's key architectural decisions:

-   **ADR-001 (DDD):** It creates a clean separation between the core domain logic and the external infrastructure.
-   **ADR-002 (Event-Driven):** The centralized domain is the single, reliable source of all trading-related events for the rest of the system.
-   **ADR-006 (Python-First):** It allows the team to build on the existing, high-quality Python domain while abstracting away the external integration.
