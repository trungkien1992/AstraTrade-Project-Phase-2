# Assumptions: Enhanced Infrastructure Deployment

Generated on: August 2, 2025
Task: Deploy Enhanced API Gateway with Production-Ready Infrastructure

## Technical Assumptions

### Environment
- **Python 3.13**: System has Python 3.13 installed (confirmed: ✅)
- **Docker**: Docker is available for containerization (confirmed: ✅ v28.1.1)
- **Redis**: Redis will be available for service discovery and rate limiting
- **Network Access**: Required for downloading dependencies and Docker images

### Dependencies
- **Pip Installation**: Will need to resolve pip dependency compilation issues
- **System Libraries**: May need system-level libraries for asyncpg, orjson compilation
- **Virtual Environment**: May need isolated Python environment for clean installation

### Infrastructure
- **Port Availability**: Ports 8000-8010 available for microservices
- **Memory**: Sufficient memory for multiple containerized services (~2GB)
- **Disk Space**: Adequate space for Docker images and artifacts

### Database Architecture
- **Current State**: Single database with domain separation via schemas/tables
- **Migration Strategy**: Database connection pooling can handle multiple container connections
- **Transaction Scope**: Cross-domain transactions handled through event-driven patterns (not distributed transactions)
- **Data Consistency**: Eventually consistent across domains via Redis Streams events

### Event System
- **Redis Streams**: Event bus remains centralized, containers connect as clients
- **Consumer Groups**: Existing 17 consumer groups continue to operate from containers
- **Correlation Tracking**: Request tracing preserved across container boundaries
- **Event Schema**: No changes to existing event schemas during containerization

### Service Communication
- **API Gateway**: Continues as single entry point, routes to containerized services
- **Service Discovery**: Redis-based registry supports container registration
- **Load Balancing**: Simple round-robin through API Gateway (not advanced service mesh)
- **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoints for container health monitoring

## Performance Assumptions

### Response Times
- **API Latency**: Container overhead adds <10ms to existing response times
- **Startup Time**: Python FastAPI containers start within 30 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Each domain service consumes <512MB RAM
- **CPU Utilization**: Container orchestration overhead <10% of current usage

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Each domain can scale independently (future capability)  
- **Event Throughput**: 10k+ events/second maintained across containerized consumers
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections efficiently shared per service
- **Resource Limits**: Containers operate within defined resource constraints

## Operational Assumptions

### Deployment Process
- **Zero Downtime**: Gradual container rollout with health check validation
- **Rollback Strategy**: Docker image tags enable quick rollback to monolith
- **Monitoring**: Existing Prometheus/Grafana continues monitoring containers
- **Service Discovery**: Container registration/deregistration automated

### Development Workflow
- **Docker Images**: Multi-stage builds for optimized production images
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration externalized for container environments
- **Logging**: Centralized logging through Docker log drivers
- **Testing**: Integration tests validate cross-container communication

## Open Questions / Unknowns

### Technical Unknowns
1. **Database Connection Limits**: Will shared database handle 6+ concurrent service connections efficiently?
2. **Event Bus Latency**: Any performance impact from multiple containers connecting to Redis Streams?
3. **Container Networking**: Optimal Docker network configuration for service-to-service communication?
4. **Resource Optimization**: Actual memory/CPU usage per containerized domain service?

### Operational Unknowns  
1. **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green vs rolling deployment for containerized services?
2. **Backup Strategy**: How to handle database backups during containerized operation?
3. **Log Aggregation**: Container log management and centralization approach?
4. **Health Check Configuration**: Optimal health check intervals and failure thresholds?

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Multiple containers competing for database connections
- **Event Bus Performance**: Potential bottleneck with 6 services + 17 consumer groups
- **Service Startup Dependencies**: Container startup order and dependency management

### Medium Risk  
- **Network Configuration Complexity**: Docker networking and service discovery integration
- **Resource Contention**: Memory/CPU competition between containers
- **Migration Rollback**: Complexity of reverting to monolith if issues arise

### Low Risk
- **Development Productivity**: Familiar Python/FastAPI stack in containers
- **Monitoring Integration**: Existing observability stack supports containers
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration well understood

## Mitigation Strategies

### Connection Management
- Implement connection pooling per service with configurable limits
- Monitor database connection metrics during migration
- Circuit breaker patterns for database access

### Performance Monitoring
- Baseline current monolith performance metrics
- Real-time monitoring during container deployment  
- Automated rollback triggers on performance degradation

### Gradual Migration
- Start with least critical domain (e.g., NFT) for container migration
- Validate each service before proceeding to next domain
- Maintain parallel monolith capability during transition
