# Requirements: Enhanced Infrastructure Deployment

Generated on: Sat Aug  2 19:53:30 +07 2025

## Functional Requirements

### Core Deployment Requirements
- **API Gateway Startup**: Enhanced API Gateway must start successfully on port 8000
- **Dependency Resolution**: All Python dependencies (slowapi, asyncpg, etc.) properly installed
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and health-based routing operational
- **Circuit Breakers**: Resilience patterns functioning under failure conditions
- **Business Metrics**: Real-time KPI collection across all 6 domains
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request correlation working

### API Endpoints Operational
- `POST /api/v1/trading/execute` - Trading execution with enhanced features
- `GET /api/v1/gamification/user/{id}/profile` - Gamification profiles
- `GET /api/v1/social/feed` - Social feed functionality
- `POST /api/v1/users/register` - User registration
- `GET /health` - Enhanced health checks with dependency validation
- `GET /services` - Service discovery registry view
- `GET /metrics` - Business and infrastructure metrics

### Enhanced Features Validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user (200 req/min) and per-service (1000 req/min) limits enforced
- **Service Failover**: Automatic routing to healthy instances
- **Business KPI Tracking**: Real-time tracking of 8 business KPIs
- **Request Correlation**: Every request traced with correlation ID

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **API Response Time**: <100ms average for enhanced gateway
- **Service Discovery Lookup**: <5ms for healthy instance retrieval
- **Circuit Breaker Response**: <1 second failure detection
- **Business Metrics Refresh**: <10 seconds for KPI updates
- **Container Startup**: <30 seconds for each microservice

### Availability Requirements
- **Service Uptime**: 99.9% availability through circuit breaker protection
- **Automatic Failover**: <5 seconds to route to healthy instance
- **Health Check Frequency**: 30-second intervals with dependency validation
- **Circuit Breaker Recovery**: 30-60 second recovery windows

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory Usage**: <512MB per containerized service
- **CPU Utilization**: <10% overhead from containerization
- **Disk Space**: <2GB for all Docker images and artifacts
- **Network Latency**: <10ms additional latency from containerization

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (Deployment Blocking)
- [ ] **Dependencies Installed**: All Python packages from requirements.txt working
- [ ] **API Gateway Running**: Successfully responds on http://localhost:8000
- [ ] **Health Checks Pass**: `/health` endpoint returns service status
- [ ] **Service Discovery Works**: `/services` shows registered services
- [ ] **Basic API Functional**: At least one domain API endpoint working
- [ ] **Business Metrics Active**: `/dashboard` shows real KPI data

### Should Have (Production Ready)
- [ ] **Circuit Breakers Active**: Protection under simulated failures
- [ ] **Rate Limiting Working**: Proper blocking of excessive requests
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing**: Request correlation across service calls
- [ ] **Performance Within SLA**: Response times <100ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] **All Microservices Running**: 6 domain services healthy and registered
- [ ] **Event Bus Integration**: Redis Streams working with containerized services

### Nice to Have (Advanced Features)
- [ ] **Prometheus Metrics**: Metrics exported and scrapable
- [ ] **Grafana Dashboard**: Business KPIs displayed in dashboard
- [ ] **Container Monitoring**: Resource usage within defined limits
- [ ] **Logging Integration**: Centralized logging from all containers
- [ ] **Auto-scaling Ready**: Service discovery supports multiple instances
