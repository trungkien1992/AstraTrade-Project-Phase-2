## Scope Hypothesis
**IN SCOPE:**
- Fix Python dependency installation issues (slowapi, asyncpg, pydantic-core)

- Major architectural changes
- Full CI/CD pipeline setup

## Current Status
- ✅ Enhanced infrastructure code written and tested (conceptually)
- ❌ Dependencies not properly installed
- ❌ Real services not deployed
- ❌ API Gateway not starting due to missing dependencies
- ⚠️ Previous deployment attempt failed due to compilation issues
