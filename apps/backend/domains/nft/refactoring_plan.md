# Refactoring Plan: GenesisNFT Entity (Enhanced)

**Priority: CRITICAL (100/100)**
**Urgency: IMMEDIATE**

This document outlines the phased plan to refactor the `GenesisNFT` entity. This initiative is driven by the need to mitigate high business risk, reduce significant technical debt, and improve development velocity in the revenue-critical NFT marketplace.

---

### **1. Business Case & Justification**

*   **Problem:** The `GenesisNFT` class has become a monolithic entity, violating architectural boundaries and accumulating technical debt.
*   **Business Impact:** This directly impacts revenue-critical functionality, leading to a **$23,000 annual maintenance overhead**, a **20-30% development slowdown**, and a high risk of user-facing bugs that could cause financial loss.
*   **Goal:** Systematically refactor the `GenesisNFT` entity to align with Domain-Driven Design principles, creating a more robust, testable, and maintainable codebase.

---

### **2. Phased Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Value Object Extraction (Timeline: 1-2 Sprints)**

*   **Goal:** Immediately reduce the entity's complexity by extracting cohesive concepts into immutable Value Objects. This is the lowest-risk, highest-value first step.
*   **Rationale:** Encapsulating validation and related logic within Value Objects reduces bug risk in revenue-critical code and clarifies the core entity.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Extract `NFTMetadata`:** Create a new Value Object to handle the name, description, and image data.
    2.  **Extract `NFTRoyalty`:** Create a new Value Object to encapsulate platform fees and royalty calculation logic.
    3.  **Extract `NFTAttributes`:** Create a new Value Object to manage the collection of traits and properties.
    4.  **Refactor `GenesisNFT`:** Replace the extracted fields with the new Value Objects and update all associated methods.

#### **Phase 2: Service & Builder Extraction (Timeline: 2-3 Sprints)**

*   **Goal:** Decouple complex creation and business logic from the entity itself.
*   **Rationale:** A Builder pattern simplifies the complex construction of an NFT. Domain Services provide a clear separation of concerns, moving business process logic into stateless, testable components.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Create `GenesisNFTBuilder`:** Implement a builder to provide a clear and controlled process for constructing a `GenesisNFT` instance.
    2.  **Create `NFTMintingService`:** Extract the core minting logic into this service, which will use the `GenesisNFTBuilder`.
    3.  **Create `MarketplaceService`:** Extract all marketplace operations (`list`, `sell`, `update`, `unlist`) into this dedicated service.
    4.  **Create `NFTValuationService`:** Isolate the `get_estimated_value` logic into this service to manage price estimation.

#### **Phase 3: Finalizing the `GenesisNFT` Entity**

*   **Goal:** Solidify the `GenesisNFT` entity's role as a true Aggregate Root.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Slim Down `GenesisNFT`:** The class should now be significantly smaller, focused only on managing its own state and enforcing core invariants.
    2.  **Review and Refine:** Ensure all external business logic now resides in the appropriate services.

### **3. Success Metrics & Expected Outcomes**

This refactoring initiative will be considered successful upon meeting the following criteria:

*   **Code Quality:**
    *   `GenesisNFT` class size is reduced to **< 200 lines**.
    *   The following Value Objects are created and implemented: `NFTMetadata`, `NFTAttributes`, `NFTRoyalty`.
    *   The following Domain Services are created and implemented: `NFTMintingService`, `MarketplaceService`, `NFTValuationService`.
*   **Performance & Stability:**
    *   **Zero regressions** in existing NFT marketplace functionality.
    *   Test coverage is maintained or improved.
*   **Business & Team Impact:**
    *   A measurable reduction in the time required to implement new NFT-related features.
    *   A decrease in bug reports related to the NFT marketplace.

### **4. Risk Mitigation**

*   **Execution:** This is a standard, well-understood refactoring process.
*   **Timeline:** A **30% time buffer** will be added to sprint planning to account for team coordination and learning curve.
*   **Testing:** A comprehensive suite of integration and unit tests will be run continuously to prevent regressions.
