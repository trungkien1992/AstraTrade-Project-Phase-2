## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Value Objects (5 classes)
- `ExperiencePoints`: XP calculation with source tracking and multipliers
- `AchievementBadge`: Badge system with rarity multipliers and rewards
- `ConstellationRank`: Role-based permissions with authority levels
- `SocialMetrics`: Viral scoring and engagement calculations
- `RewardPackage`: Multi-currency reward bundling with validation

#### Entities (5 classes)  
- `UserProgression`: Complete user advancement with level calculation
- `Constellation`: Clan management with battle rating system
- `Achievement`: Achievement definitions with unlock condition validation
- `Leaderboard`: Ranking system with time-based resets
- `Reward`: Reward claiming with expiration handling

#### Domain Service (1 class)
- `GamificationDomainService`: Unified service consolidating all functionality
  - User progression management
  - Achievement checking and unlocking
  - Constellation creation and management
  - Leaderboard ranking and updates
  - Reward distribution and claiming
  - Viral content scoring and rewards

### Business Logic Highlights

#### XP System Architecture
```python
# Multi-source XP with precision
trading_xp = ExperiencePoints.trading_xp(
    trade_volume=Decimal('1000.50'),
    profit_loss=Decimal('123.45')
)
# Result: Base XP (100.05) + Profit bonus (61.725) = 161.775 XP
```

#### Achievement Unlock System
```python
# Rarity-based reward calculation  
badge = AchievementBadge.trading_milestone(1000)  # Epic rarity
total_reward = badge.xp_reward * badge.rarity_multiplier  # 500 * 2.0 = 1000 XP
```

#### Constellation Battle Scoring
```python
# Member contribution aggregation
battle_score = sum([
    member.successful_trades * 10 +
    max(member.profit_loss * 0.1, 0) +
    member.current_streak * 5
    for member in constellation_members
])
```

## Domain Event System

### Event Types Implemented
- `xp_awarded`: XP distribution with source tracking
- `level_up`: User progression milestones
- `achievement_unlocked`: Badge earning with rewards
- `streak_updated`: Activity streak progression
- `streak_broken`: Streak interruption tracking
- `member_joined/left`: Constellation membership changes
- `battle_completed`: Battle results and rating updates
- `reward_claimed`: Reward distribution confirmation

### Event Architecture Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: Domains communicate via events
- **Audit Trail**: Complete action history
- **Real-time Updates**: UI synchronization capability
- **Eventual Consistency**: Distributed system readiness

## Performance Optimizations

### Financial Precision

## Integration Guidelines

### Repository Implementation Required
```python
# Example repository implementation needed:
class SQLUserProgressionRepository:
    async def get_by_user_id(self, user_id: int) -> Optional[UserProgression]:
        # Database query implementation
        pass
    
    async def save(self, progression: UserProgression) -> UserProgression:
        # Database persistence implementation
        pass
```

### Event Bus Integration
```python
# Event handling setup:
async def setup_event_handlers(event_bus: EventBus):
    await event_bus.subscribe("achievement_unlocked", notify_user_handler)
    await event_bus.subscribe("level_up", update_ui_handler)
    await event_bus.subscribe("battle_completed", update_leaderboard_handler)
```

### Service Registration
```python
# Dependency injection setup:
gamification_service = GamificationDomainService(
    user_progression_repo=user_progression_repo,
    constellation_repo=constellation_repo,
    achievement_repo=achievement_repo,
    leaderboard_repo=leaderboard_repo,
    reward_repo=reward_repo
)
```
