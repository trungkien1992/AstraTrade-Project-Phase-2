Ideation Sprint (60–80 minutes)

Phase 0: Setup (5 min)
- Define the challenge: one-line “How might we…”
- Constraints: budget/time/tech; must-haves and no-go’s.
- Participants: 3–7 people, diverse roles; assign a facilitator and scribe.
- Tools: shared doc/board, timer, dot stickers or virtual votes.

Phase 1: Warm-up Divergence (10 min)
- Silent “Crazy 8s”: each person sketches/writes 8 variations in 8 minutes.
- Prompts:
  - 10x cheaper/faster
  - Zero UI
  - Mobile-only or offline-first
  - AI-assisted or fully automated
  - Social/viral twist
  - Privacy-first or local-only
  - Platform/plugin form
  - Marketplace or API product
- Output: ~40–50 raw ideas across the group.

Phase 2: Expand and Combine (10–15 min)
- Round-robin share: 30–60s per person to highlight 2–3 ideas.
- “Yes, and…” building; add constraints-busting variations.
- Cluster similar ideas into themes.
- Output: 5–8 themed clusters with headline summaries.

Phase 3: Feasibility and Impact (10 min)
- For each cluster, rate Impact (1–5) and Feasibility (1–5).
- Plot on a 2x2; identify quick wins vs moonshots.
- Mark assumptions and biggest risks for top clusters.
- Output: 2–3 candidate ideas to take forward.

Phase 4: Lightning Prototypes (15–20 min)
- Split into pairs; pick one candidate each.
- 1-page concept sheet:
  - Value proposition: for [user], [problem], [solution], [benefit].
  - Key flow: 3–5 steps sketch or bullets.
  - Differentiator: why now/why us.
  - Success metric: what moves if it works.
  - Riskiest assumption: and how to test fast.
- Output: 2–3 sheets with minimal mockups.

Phase 5: Vote and Decide (5–10 min)
- Dot voting: each person 3 dots (2 for top, 1 for runner-up).
- Decision: highest votes wins unless veto on constraints.
- Agree on a 1–2 week discovery experiment to test the riskiest assumption.
- Output: Selected idea + experiment plan.

Phase 6: Immediate Next Steps (10 min)
- Mini experiment plan:
  - Hypothesis: “We believe X will Y; we’ll know it when metric Z changes.”
  - Test: landing page + signups, concierge prototype, or Figma click-test.
  - Data: success threshold (e.g., 5% signup CR, 8/10 task completion).
  - Owners, timeline, budget.
- Create a tracking ticket and schedule check-in.
- Output: Ticket with owners, date, success criteria.

Facilitator Checklist
- Timebox each phase
- One conversation at a time
- Encourage wild ideas; defer judgment in divergence
- Capture everything; avoid perfecting mockups
- End with a concrete experiment and owner
