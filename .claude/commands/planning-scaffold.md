Concise Planning Scaffold (Time-boxed, Risk-aware)

1) Define the task
- One-line goal: What outcome by when?
- Success criteria: 3–5 checkable statements.
- Constraints: Time, budget, dependencies, compliance.
- Stakeholders: Decision-maker, approvers, consumers.
Output: Task Brief

2) Decompose and sequence
- 3–7 atomic subtasks; map dependencies and critical path.
- Assign owners and time boxes; identify parallelizable work.
Output: Work Plan

3) Risk and assumption check
- Top 5 risks with mitigation/trigger.
- Max 5 assumptions; validate or monitor.
- Define kill switches and rollback.
Output: Risk Register, Assumptions

4) Resourcing and environment
- People, tools, repos, envs, data, access, licenses.
- Pre-flight checks for access/seeds/quotas.
Output: Readiness Checklist

5) Execution cadence
- Standups/check-ins cadence and channel.
- Working agreements: PR size, review SLA, DoD.
- Metrics: pick 2 (lead time, WIP, CFR).
Output: Team Cadence

6) Quality and gates
- Testing approach, coverage targets.
- CI gates: lint, types, security, perf, contract diff.
- Manual gates: demo, sign-off criteria.
Output: Quality Plan

7) Communication and artifacts
- Docs: README/update, ADR, changelog, runbook.
- Stakeholder updates cadence.
- Acceptance package: test report, perf results, SBOM.
Output: Deliverables List

8) Timeline and milestones
- Spike/POC, MVP, Ready to release, Post-release validation.
Output: Timeline

9) Optional 1–2 day spike
- Unknowns, prototype plan, go/no-go.
Output: Spike Findings

10) Post-completion
- Retro, debt log, hand-off.
Output: Closeout Report
