# Current Session Context - AstraTrade Development

## 🎯 Project Status: Phase 2A Complete, Ready for Database Integration

### What This Project Is:
AstraTrade is a comprehensive trading platform built with **microservices architecture** and **domain-driven design**. We're implementing real production-grade services, not prototypes.

### Current Architecture:
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI microservices with PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Separate domains (User, Trading, Gamification, etc.)
- **Event-Driven**: Redis Streams for inter-service communication
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, service discovery, health checks

## 🚨 Critical Engineering Standards

### Mandatory Rules (see `.claude/project-rule/No_lazy.md`):
1. **No Lazy Shortcuts**: Never create workarounds, mocks in production, or temporary solutions
2. **Real User Data Integration**: User provides actual requirements, no assumptions allowed
3. **Long-term Architecture First**: Fix root causes, not symptoms
4. **Complete Components**: Finish one service fully before moving to next

### Development Approach:
- User acts as **real product owner** providing actual data and requirements
- **Zero technical debt** during development
- **Production-ready code** from day one
- **Real user validation** for every feature

## 🎯 Current Task: Database Schema with Real User Data

### What's Done:
- ✅ User service working with domain entities
- ✅ Trading service architecture complete with proper DDD
- ✅ Infrastructure foundation solid (base services)
- ✅ No technical debt accumulated

### What's Next:
1. **Get real user requirements** for database schema (DON'T ASSUME)
2. **Create production database schema** based on actual needs
3. **Implement repository pattern** for domain services
4. **Connect services to real PostgreSQL + Redis**

### How to Continue:
1. **Read the rules**: `.claude/project-rule/No_lazy.md`
2. **Ask user for real data**: Database structure, business rules, integration needs
3. **Use established patterns**: Follow user/trading service architecture
4. **Track progress**: Use TodoWrite tool to update task status

## 🔧 Technical Patterns Established

### Service Structure:
```python
# All services follow this pattern:
from services.base import create_app, get_database_session, get_event_bus
from domains.{domain}.entities import {Entity}
from domains.{domain}.services import {DomainService}

# Domain entity creation:
user = User(username=Username(name), security_credentials=SecurityCredentials(...))
trade = Trade(user_id=1, asset=Asset(...), direction=TradeDirection.LONG, ...)

# Event publishing (dictionary format):
await event_bus.publish_event("astra.domain.event.v1", {"key": "value"})
```

### Repository Pattern:
```python
# Domain services expect injected repositories:
class TradingDomainService:
    def __init__(self, trade_repository: TradeRepository, ...):
        self._trade_repo = trade_repository
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Phase 2A Achievements:
- **Zero Technical Debt**: All shortcuts eliminated
- **Consistent Architecture**: Both services follow same patterns  
- **Working Domain Models**: Entities validated and functional
- **Production Foundation**: Ready for real database integration

### Phase 2B Goals:
- Real database schema based on user requirements
- Working repository implementations
- Full service-to-database integration
- Event system connected to Redis Streams

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

1. **NEVER make assumptions** - always ask user for real requirements
2. **FOLLOW established patterns** from user/trading services
3. **NO mocks in production code** - only real implementations
4. **UPDATE todo list** with TodoWrite tool as you progress
5. **READ the engineering rules** before starting any work

The foundation is solid. Now we need the user's real requirements to complete the architecture properly.
